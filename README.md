# USDA Natural Amenity Scale
This is an update of the USDA's Natural Amenity Scale (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale) with more recent temperature data. The original scale used temperature data from 1941-1970. This update uses temperature data from 2010-2014, downloaded from NOAA here: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/

Average NOAA temperature data is in columns AH through AJ.

The file includes all original amenity scale values, located in column Z and AA. New amenity scores are located in column AD, and the difference between old and new scores is in column AE.

The formulas and coefficients for July temp z-scores were calculated with the aid of ChatGPT, based on the USDA description provided here: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale/documentation. Calculated versions of the original data z-scores are also provided (columns X and Y). You can compare them to the originally provided z-scores in coumns AN and AO.
